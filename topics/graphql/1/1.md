# Why GraphQL

GraphQL solves a particular set of problems that comes from RESTFul routing. Unless we encounter those problems there is no need of using GraphQL

RESTFul routing: Given a collection of records on a server, there should be a uniform URL and HTTP request method used to utilize that collection of records, most importantly the CRUD operations.
